# Debug Steps for Blank Screen Issue

## Issue Summary
The page goes blank after selecting "Operator" role. 

## Root Causes Found and Fixed:

1. **Import Error in DashboardScreen.tsx**
   - Fixed: Changed `import { DashboardScreen }` to `import DashboardScreen` in AppNavigator.tsx
   - Fixed: Changed `import { LoadingSpinner } from '@/components'` to `import LoadingSpinner from '../components/LoadingSpinner'`

2. **Navigation Structure Issue**
   - Temporarily simplified navigation to bypass TabNavigator and directly show OperatorDashboard/StoreManagerDashboard based on user role
   - Fixed indentation issues in the Stack.Screen configuration

3. **Added Debug Logging**
   - Added console.log statements in:
     - RoleSelectionScreen (to track role selection and navigation)
     - AppNavigator (to track currentUser state)
     - OperatorDashboard (to track rendering and data)

4. **Added Error Handling**
   - Created ErrorBoundary component to catch and display rendering errors
   - Added null check for currentUser in OperatorDashboard

## To Test the Fix:

1. Stop any running expo processes:
   ```bash
   pkill -f expo
   ```

2. Start the app:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. In your device/simulator:
   - Select "Operator" role
   - You should now see the Operator Dashboard instead of a blank screen

4. Check the console logs to see:
   - "Role selected: operator"
   - "User logged in: ..."
   - "Navigating to Dashboard..."
   - "OperatorDashboard rendering..."

## If Issue Persists:

1. Check the Metro bundler console for any error messages
2. Look for red error screens on the device/simulator
3. The ErrorBoundary should catch and display any rendering errors

## Next Steps (if needed):

1. Restore TabNavigator functionality once basic navigation is confirmed working
2. Add proper loading states and error handling throughout the app
3. Consider implementing a proper navigation guard system
