# SPARC Workflow for Serve AI App Development

## Overview
This document outlines the SPARC (Specification, Pseudocode, Architecture, Refinement, Completion) methodology for implementing features in the Serve AI App. This systematic approach ensures thorough planning, robust implementation, and maintainable code.

## SPARC Phases

### Phase 1: Specification
- Extract functional and non-functional requirements
- Define user stories and acceptance criteria
- Identify system boundaries and technical constraints
- Document edge cases and error scenarios

### Phase 2: Pseudocode
- Design high-level system architecture
- Create core business logic algorithms
- Develop test strategy (Test-Driven Development)
- Define data flow and state management patterns

### Phase 3: Architecture
- Define detailed component specifications
- Design data models and database schema
- Create interface definitions and API contracts
- Plan integration points and dependencies

### Phase 4: Refinement (TDD Implementation)
- Implement features using Test-Driven Development
- Follow "Red-Green-Refactor" cycle:
  - Red: Write failing tests
  - Green: Implement minimal code to pass tests
  - Refactor: Optimize while maintaining test coverage
- Use parallel development tracks for efficiency

### Phase 5: Completion
- Integrate all development tracks
- Validate against original requirements
- Prepare documentation and deployment
- Set up monitoring and observability

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
- Keep files under 500 lines
- Keep functions under 50 lines
- Maintain comprehensive test coverage (target 100%)
- Follow TypeScript best practices
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all business logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Component tests for React Native components
- End-to-end tests for critical user flows

### Security Considerations
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Validate all user inputs
- Secure API endpoints
- Protect sensitive data
- Follow OWASP guidelines

### Performance Optimization
- Lazy load components when possible
- Optimize React Native renders
- Implement efficient state management
- Cache API responses appropriately
- Monitor app performance metrics

## Current Feature Implementation

### Operator and Store Manager Views
**Objective**: Create role-based views for operators and store managers with alert assignment and tracking capabilities.

**Key Features**:
1. Operator Dashboard
   - View all alerts
   - Assign alerts to team members
   - Track alert resolution status
   - Manage team members

2. Store Manager Dashboard
   - View assigned alerts
   - Update alert status
   - Track cure/resolution progress
   - Communicate with operators

**Technical Implementation**:
- Role-based authentication system
- Alert assignment service
- Real-time status updates
- State management for assignments
- Navigation based on user role

## Commands and Scripts

### Development
```bash
npm start          # Start the development server
npm run ios        # Run on iOS simulator
npm run android    # Run on Android emulator
npm test           # Run tests
npm run lint       # Run linting
npm run typecheck  # Run TypeScript type checking
```

### Git Workflow
```bash
git checkout -b feature/branch-name  # Create feature branch
git add .                           # Stage changes
git commit -m "feat: description"   # Commit with conventional message
git push -u origin feature/branch-name  # Push to remote
```

## Architecture Decisions

### State Management
- Using React Context API for global state
- Separate contexts for different domains (Alerts, Notifications, Restaurant)
- Local component state for UI-specific data

### Navigation
- React Navigation for screen management
- Role-based navigation guards
- Deep linking support for notifications

### Data Flow
- Services layer for API communication
- Context providers for state management
- Component-level hooks for data access

### Testing Approach
- Jest for unit testing
- React Native Testing Library for components
- Mock service layer for isolated testing
- Integration tests for critical flows
