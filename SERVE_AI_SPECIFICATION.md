- Configurable demo scenarios
- Clean, maintainable code architecture

### Technical Requirements

#### Expo/React Native
- Expo SDK 52+ with managed workflow
- TypeScript for type safety
- React Navigation for routing
- Expo Notifications for local push notifications

#### State Management
- React Context API for global state
- AsyncStorage for data persistence
- Custom hooks for business logic

#### UI/UX Framework
- Native Base or Expo Router for navigation
- Custom component library
- Responsive design principles

### User Stories

#### Epic 1: Restaurant Manager Alert Management

**US1.1**: As a restaurant manager, I want to see all critical alerts prominently displayed so I can address urgent issues immediately.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Critical alerts appear at top of dashboard with red indicator
- Alert count badge shows number of unread notifications
- Critical alerts trigger push notifications immediately

**US1.2**: As a restaurant manager, I want to filter alerts by category so I can focus on specific operational areas.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Filter buttons for Inventory, Orders, Equipment, Staff categories
- Selected filter highlights and shows only relevant alerts
- Filter state persists across app sessions

**US1.3**: As a restaurant manager, I want to receive push notifications for important alerts so I stay informed even when not using the app.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Push notifications sent for High and Critical priority alerts
- Notification includes alert type and brief description
- Tapping notification opens relevant alert details

#### Epic 2: Alert Interaction and Management

**US2.1**: As a restaurant manager, I want to acknowledge alerts so I can track what has been addressed.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- "Acknowledge" button on alert cards
- Acknowledged alerts move to separate section
- Acknowledgment timestamp recorded

**US2.2**: As a restaurant manager, I want to see alert history so I can track patterns and trends.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- History tab showing past 30 days of alerts
- Alerts grouped by date with summary counts
- Search functionality within history

### Demo Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Busy Lunch Rush
- High volume of order alerts
- Equipment temperature warning
- Low inventory alert for popular item
- Staff scheduling conflict notification

#### Scenario 2: Morning Prep Issues
- Multiple inventory low-stock alerts
- Equipment maintenance reminder
- Delivery delay notification
- Health inspector visit reminder

#### Scenario 3: Evening Service
- Customer complaint alert (high priority)
- Point-of-sale system warning
- Staff overtime alert
- Special event booking notification

#### Data Models

```typescript
interface Alert {
  id: string;
  type: 'INVENTORY' | 'ORDER' | 'EQUIPMENT' | 'STAFF' | 'CUSTOMER';
  priority: 'CRITICAL' | 'HIGH' | 'MEDIUM' | 'LOW';
  title: string;
  message: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  acknowledged: boolean;
  resolved: boolean;
  data: Record<string, any>;
}

interface Restaurant {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  type: 'FAST_CASUAL' | 'FINE_DINING' | 'COFFEE_SHOP' | 'BAR';
  alerts: Alert[];
}
```

### Success Metrics

#### Prototype Goals
- Successfully demonstrate end-to-end alert notification flow
- Show 3+ different alert categories with appropriate prioritization
- Demonstrate both in-app and push notification handling
- Present professional, investor-ready demo experience

#### Technical Validation
- Zero crashes during demo scenarios
- Smooth navigation between all screens
- Push notifications work reliably on iOS simulator
- Mock data generates realistic restaurant scenarios

### Constraints and Assumptions

#### Constraints
- No real backend integration required for prototype
- iOS simulator testing only (no physical device deployment needed)
- English language only
- Single restaurant context per demo session

#### Assumptions
- Users will have Expo Go app installed for demo
- Demo will be presented on macOS with iOS simulator
- Network connectivity available for initial app setup
- Target audience familiar with restaurant operations

### Risk Assessment

#### Technical Risks
- **Risk**: Expo limitations for push notifications
- **Mitigation**: Use local notifications for demo, clearly document push notification approach

- **Risk**: iOS simulator notification limitations
- **Mitigation**: Test on physical device if needed, provide fallback demo scenarios

#### Business Risks  
- **Risk**: Mock data not realistic enough for investor demo
- **Mitigation**: Research actual restaurant alert patterns, use industry-specific terminology

- **Risk**: App performance issues during presentation
- **Mitigation**: Implement performance monitoring, optimize for demo scenarios

### Success Criteria
1. **Functional**: All user stories implemented and tested
2. **Technical**: App runs smoothly on iOS simulator with <3s load time
3. **Demo**: Professional presentation-ready prototype with configurable scenarios
4. **Code Quality**: TypeScript implementation with proper error handling and testing
5. **Architecture**: Scalable foundation suitable for real backend integration

This specification serves as the foundation for implementing the Serve AI restaurant notification prototype using the SPARC workflow methodology.
